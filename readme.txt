This is the repository to store different versions of glew library. 
Q: Why in this way?
A: The library seems to old for me and it does not support cmake as it could. Instead of building project files for number 
	of platforms via cmake it uses mingw. Thus instead of learning another one build system it is simpler just to get the sources.
